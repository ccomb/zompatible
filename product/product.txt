PRODUCT
=======
A product can be hardware or software.

Let's create a new product (a multi function USB printer/scanner/card reader)::

    >>> from zompatible.product.product import Product
    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy, alsoProvides
    >>> multi = Product(u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180')

We can also create this Product using a factory::

    >>> from zompatible.product.product import productFactory
    >>> multi = productFactory(u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180')

A product is basically a contained persistent object::

    >>> list(providedBy(multi))
    [<InterfaceClass zompatible.product.interfaces.IProduct>, <InterfaceClass zope.app.container.interfaces.IContained>, <InterfaceClass persistent.interfaces.IPersistent>]

The name of the product is available in the name attribute::

    >>> multi.name
    u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180'

A product can have several names, and the main name is the first name::

    >>> multi.names
    [u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180']
    >>> multi.names.append(u'HP Photosmart C-5180')
    >>> multi.names
    [u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180', u'HP Photosmart C-5180']
    >>> multi.name = u'HP Photosmart C-5180'
    >>> multi.names = [u'HP Photosmart C-5180', u'Hewlett-Packard PhotoSmart C5180']

We can write a description of the object::

    >>> multi.description = u"This is a multifunction device"
    >>> multi.description
    u'This is a multifunction device'

The product is currently associated with no organization

    >>> multi.organization

We can put the product into an organization, and 
The organization happens to be the container for the product!::

    >>> from zompatible.organization.organization import Organization
    >>> orga1 = Organization(u'orga1')
    >>> multi.organization = orga1
    >>> multi in orga1.values()
    True
    >>> multi.name in orga1
    True

We can set another organization for the product, and
the product is moved to the new organization::

    >>> orga2 = Organization(u'orga2')
    >>> multi.organization = orga2
    >>> multi in orga1.values()
    False
    >>> multi in orga2.values()
    True
